We created a game-like application that, using machine learning, can identify the psychological profiles of users, helping them maintain their mental health during social isolation. This profile is drawn from interactions at the application, analysis of usage of other applications, data about social interaction (such as logbooks or blogs kept by astronauts in the ISS, for example) and physiological data, obtained by the accompanying hardware used by astronauts, or by personal-use hardware people carry every day. The result is a suggestion of approaches for direct mitigation (such as music or meditation) or indirect mitigation (such as contacting a close friend or a relative).

The application can produce a psychological profile of users by cross-analysing their interaction with the interface, digital presence information (social media, blogs, logbooks) and behavioral patterns. Mitigation solutions can then be suggested to the user in a challenge format. The advice is optimized according to usersâ€™ needs, and can range from meditation to music to having a conversation with relatives. In cases of extreme behavior, family or friends can be alerted and encouraged to interact with the user. The result is a better use of the resources and support available to people, and, with that, a healthier mind.
