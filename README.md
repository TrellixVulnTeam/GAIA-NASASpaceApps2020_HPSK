## Project Description

We created a game-like application that, using machine learning, can identify the psychological profiles of users, helping them maintain their mental health during social isolation. This profile is drawn from interactions at the application, analysis of usage of other applications, data about social interaction (such as logbooks or blogs kept by astronauts in the ISS, for example) and physiological data, obtained by the accompanying hardware used by astronauts, or by personal-use hardware people carry every day. The result is a suggestion of approaches for direct mitigation (such as music or meditation) or indirect mitigation (such as contacting a close friend or a relative).
